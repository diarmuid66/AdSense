  <p>MAF05 Ads Connect: Ads Platform for Small News Publishers Networks 
Diarmuid Mc Cann (40239253)
GitLab: https://gitlab2.eeecs.qub.ac.uk/40239253/adsense
Introduction 
This project is to create a minimum viable advertising platform to be used by a community of small publishers. They can use it to share their resources such as their user data or advertising space. The system will collect user data ethically and legally then use this data to match ads relevant to the user based on their browsing activity, for example if the users are reading content about fashion then ads to do with fashion will get generated from an ad pool database. 

Problem Description
Small publishers used to receive 100% payment for advertisements placed with them. Nowadays small publishers are suffering with targeted advertising being favoured over direct ads, which are the favoured and most profitable for the small publishers. The large advertising networks, I have seen multiple web sources refer to it as a Duopoly (Facebook and Google) have a large pool of adverts that they can optimise with their large amounts of user data. 
Small publishers don’t have the same amount of computing power as large organisations and they aren’t as technical minded so this is a huge disadvantage. Not having access to large user data can make it hard to give relevant ads to each user. This is really starting to eat at revenue for publishers and revenue can go from 100% of ad revenue to only 30% so a loss of up to 70%. It all boils down to the bigger companies taking large portions of the ad fees. Direct advertising show user’s ads indiscriminately, this can result in users getting irrelevant ads which will be unlikely to be of any interest to them so there is less chance of them clicking to buy the advertised product.  
Facebook alone has around 9million advertisers. These two account for roughly 70% of digital ad spending worldwide and have threatened the future of journalism.







Contextual Targeting ads versus Behavioural Targeting ads
Contextual Advertising
Contextual advertisements are classed as non-disruptive, this is because users will get targeted with ads that don’t hinder their experience on the webapp by showing ads relevant to what they’re browsing.  If a user was reading content about cooking and an advertisement for recipe books or cookware appeared then this would be relevant to interests and classed as non-disruptive. Contextual ads aim to maximise conversion rates by showing users a product or service that they would likely be interested in based on the current website or page the user is on.  
Problems
Data is limited to only gathering content users browse. 
Behavioural Advertising 
Behavioural advertising segments users according to their web browsing behaviour. The data collected is their browsing history, searches, links clicked, and purchases that determine what ads they will see.  After the filtering of this  data its matched to audience segments which are users with similar behaviours. Each segment is used to target them with relevant ads or content.   
Problems 
The main problem with this is that it still uses cookies to gather this data. A disclaimer must be shown on sites that use this method to their users that then need to consent to sharing their personal data. 
Differences 
Contextual advertising is generated on a page with relevant content so that the ad is shown to every visitor of that website. 
Behavioural advertising you are able to be more specific, using data such as users age, browsing behaviour or their gender etc. It is specific to a user based on the audience segment they have been assigned to. 
Conclusion 
I have decided that the best form of advertising to use on the webapp will be contextual advertising. This is due to it being the most private and most suitable to the main goals of the system(Gathering data for relevant ads without ever using personal information). 

Facebook Ads 
Facebook ads have a range of budgets for advertising so it can suit publishers that are just starting out with little advertising revenue so they are the most affordable form of advertising.  You can spend as little as £1 a day on the platform, which includes placements across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and their Audience Network.   With this in mind it can also mean the reach of the ads will be much less if the budget is low. Facebook target ads based on the sex, demographic and geographic information of users.  This data can be used to advertise to their target audience, the data Facebook has can be used to be highly targetable. For example if advertisers had a product suitable for a certain demographic and sex then it will filter the ads to that specific group. 
Google AdSense 
Google AdSense pays pennies per view and the rate can depend on many different factors such as seasonal rates or the region of site traffic . So unless a website has massive traffic it will be harder for small publishers selling their advertising space this way. They have different types of ways to get paid such as CPC (Cost per click) and CPM (Cost per thousand impressions) which is an income model where advertisers pay you a fixed price per thousand ad impressions.  Another newer type is CPE (Cost per engagement) so the advertiser defines an action the user has to do such as clicking an ad , watch a video ad, finishing a quiz or poll etc.  
Personally it seems a one dimensional  way for small publishers to make money from ads as it takes away the potential for bigger profits from commission if the users make a purchase. Publishers are only paid for the user viewing the ad and it’s based on site traffic. This could prove to be difficult to make money, especially for small publishers that are just starting out with very few site traffic. 
Conclusion 
Google AdSense and Facebook ads have their pros and cons and can be a good way for small publishers to make money to stay afloat, the issue is that with increasing costs there has to be a better way for them to prioritize from advertising. This is why building the system for the publishers to gather resources and collect user data without ever collecting sensitive or personal information will be greatly beneficial. 



Why the current advertising ecosystem is problematic
The current advertising ecosystem helps to spread junk news & disinformation. The overwhelming majority of junk news & disinformation domains rely on major advertising platforms to monetize their pages and 61% of junk news & disinformation sources used Google ads. 15% used Amazon ads   Many of the big companies including Facebook, Amazon and Google, with their high trust, willingly spread disinformation to increase their visibility and popularity. 
Facebook
Facebook has tried to stop misinformation spreading during the pandemic, they started to combat all the potentially harmful misinformation being spread about COVID 19.   They started to remove misleading info and link users up to better sources. Although they still allowed the spread of other misinformation about climate change and others. Facebook  lacked a clear policy on how climate changed related content was handled. It was counted as opinion so wasn’t fact checked but that has changed now too to stop the misinformation. 
A new study from the New York University and the Université Grenoble Alpes in France. Researchers found  from August 2020 to January 2021, publishers known for putting out misinformation got six times the amount of likes, shares, and comments as trustworthy news sources did. 
Google
Its beneficial for a search engine to give content to users that they want to read or click on. The problem with this is that Google and other search engines are using the relevant feedback data for bumping ads up in the list, so if people see some entertaining sounding headline that’s totally false then they are likely to click on it and help boost the popularity of this type of fake content. So when people start clicking out of interest to misinformation, Google end up serving these ads as top results. 
Google was fined €50,000000 in 2020 for GDPR breaches. The case was about how Google provided users privacy notice and gained consent for personalized advertising and other types of data processing. This was caused by not providing proper info to users in consent policies and not allowing more control over how their data is used.   

How contextual advertising could help small publishers?
Relevancy 
Whoever views each ad will more than likely be interested based on the context of the webpage. This means more efficient use of ads so more money can be charged per ad, increasing revenue. 
Privacy 
No personal data is collected, ads are generated based on the page content being browsed. This will attract more traffic to the site since its trustworthy and will attract more revenue. 
Market Potential
The Global Contextual Advertising Market is predicted to reach $335.1 Billion by 2026,  according to a study by Global Industry Analysts Inc, (GIA) the premier market research company.  This shows the potential this market has, all while maintaining readers trust and increasing profits for the publishers. As cookies are on the verge of being phased out, it’s a good strategy using contextual advertising with it’s no need for cookies. Even Google Chrome browser won’t be allowing the use of third party cookies by 2023 so this will future proof revenue from content. 
The New York Times started using contextual advertising in 2020 on their website. They’ve generated as much revenue from contextual targeting in the first six months as they did throughout 2019. Some advertisers are willing to pay as much as 50% more for contextual ads.  
Who Benefits from the system
Users 
Once implemented the system will benefit the users by generating relevant adverts suited to their interests using browsing activity data. This will increase the chances of each user making a purchase if the add they see is of something they like. 
Small Publishers 
Small publishers will receive more advertising revenue and commission for any purchases made. This system will optimise ads to match the user’s interests resulting in a more efficient use of advertising space. This will increase sales as relevant ads are more likely to attract the user into making a purchase to further increase revenue. 
Advertisers 
Ads are optimised for users interested in certain categories using the meta data from the pages the users browse. This is beneficial to the advertisers as ads are used in an efficient way and more likely not wasting them shown to uninterested users. 
Justification 
Small publishers can use this system to monetise from their users activities by generating ads relevant to each individual. This makes it more likely each user will make a purchase if it’s an ad they have an interest in, such as purchasing music tickets, the ad would be generated if the user was browsing content about music. It matches this data to the ad pool and selects the most suited ad so it’s less likely to be an ad the user has no interest in for better efficiency. It saves publishers money too, helping them to avoid paying out most of their ad revenue to large platforms. 
Software Development Environment
•	PHP web based application(HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
•	Using VS Code to implement this along with PHP my admin
•	Offered as a cloud service

Success Criteria
Research and planning
Quality research and planning will help and having frequent meetings with my project supervisor and champion.  Setting small targets to work on and keeping on schedule for all deadlines set out. 
Test the system for users 
I will have testers for the system after implementation to gather as much feedback as possible. Getting constructive criticism and suggested improvements will help success. 
Feedback Implementation
Based on the feedback received I will implement if feasible to further enhance the quality and success of the system. 





Goals and Requirements 
Functional Requirements 
1.	Users are able to add and remove adverts to the ads pool. 
2.	Users are able to browse to their preferred page content.
3.	User can click on the ad within the webpage to get re-directed for buying/subscribing to the product offered.    
Non-Functional Requirements 
1.	Data is collected ethically with no need for personal data. 
2.	System should be user friendly and easy to navigate. 
3.	Ads Generated based on content data, matching the keywords collected.
4.	System will fairly distribute each advertisers ad from the ads pool.
5.	System will gather data based on content browsed.
6.	Generate the ads in a non-invasive way that fits nice on the webpage. 

Design Considerations

•	User Interface Design (if applicable). Show sketches of the design or screenshots with explanations of choices made, if necessary.


•	Software System Design. The role of each component and the interfaces between components should be described.  There should be a clear correlation between your design and your specification.

•	Where applicable give a critical discussion of key design decisions/styles/patterns used; data model; UI design, external Interfaces, 














Test and improve 
Have users test the system for any faults, issues or things they think can be improved. Ask them for feedback and suggestions for improvement. If it’s feasible and deemed to be beneficial I will implement any suggested improvements. 
Main goal 
At the end of the project I will have a fully functional application that meets all the user requirements. Gather data ethically and legally, it will only ever use user browsing content data and no personal data at all.  Increase profits for small publishers so they don’t have to waste ad revenue. I will also have an interface for the publishers to update ads in the database. The system will also have algorithms to allow for fair ad distribution. 











Primary persona 	 
Small Publishers 
End goal
Using page meta data in the webapp to tag what content interests the users based on this data it can allow an ethical way of collecting data without ever having to gather sensitive information. The ads can be optimised with this data so the distribution of ads will be more efficient and likely to be relevant to the user so they will click and potentially make a purchase, sign up for a subscription or whatever the ad may be. Will also have a web interface to allow for the publishers to add their own ads to the database of adverts. An algorithm will be used to make sure all the ads are fairly rotated for each publisher. 
Scenario
The publishers will be able to add their resources and share their ad space through this platform. Profits from advertising has been decreased from as high as 70% so this platform helps them get better profits from efficient ad use, commissions and ethical data collection. 
Secondary persona 
Webapp readers/subscribers/users
End Goal 
Be able to browse content that interests them without their personal information or sensitive data being collected from them. Have an easy to navigate interface and only see ads that match the content that interests them. 
Scenario
The users will want quality content to easily navigate the system without the annoyance of irrelevant ads. All the text should be easy to read and the overall webapp should be aesthetically pleasing for a more professional look.
